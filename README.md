ativayeban

You are a ball and you must fall into the holes to avoid being crushed by the top of the screen!

This game requires SDL 1.2 and a C compiler. It is optimised for low-resolution screens.

Everything's under the GPL version 2.

To compile this for PC, use `make clean; make` on a PC with SDL. You'll then get a windowed SDL game.

To compile this for OpenDingux, use `make TARGET=ativayeban-od clean; make TARGET=ativayeban-od opk` on a PC with the `PATH` set to include your OpenDingux mipsel toolchain.
